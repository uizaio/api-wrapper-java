# Uiza

## Introduction

This is documents the public API for Uiza version 3.0.

The Uiza API is organized around RESTful standard.
Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors.
JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors, although our API libraries convert responses to appropriate language-specific objects.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

## Authentication

In order, to use the Uiza, you should follow these steps:

* **Step 1:** Having an active Uiza account. (If you don't have, please get [here](https://id.uiza.io/)).
* **Step 2:** Once you have an Uiza account, you can get a Token to call the APIs.

This Token will have right & permission related with your account.

## Requirements

Java 8 or later.

See details [here](https://docs.uiza.io/#callback).

## Analytic

Monitor the four key dimensions of video QoS: playback failures, startup time, rebuffering, and video quality.
These 15 metrics help you track playback performance, so your team can know exactly whatâ€™s going on.

You can see all available APIs for analytic in [ANALYTIC.md](https://github.com/uizaio/api-wrapper-java/blob/master_v3/doc/ANALYTIC.md).
See details [here](https://docs.uiza.io/#analytic).

## User Management

You can manage user with APIs user. Uiza have 2 levels of user:

`Admin` - This account will have the highest priority, can have permission to create & manage users.
